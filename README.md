<strong>Question 1. [2 Marks] </strong>Consider your student number, <em>n </em>to be a natural number. Find natural numbers <em>q,r </em>with 0 ≤ <em>r &lt; </em>3 such that <em>n </em>= 3<em>q </em>+ <em>r</em>.

<strong>Question 2. [2 Marks] </strong>Using the value of <em>r </em>computed in Question 1 above answer <strong>only </strong>part (<em>r</em>) of this question:

<ul>

 <li>Let P, Q be statements. Write down a compound statement that is true when one and only one of P or Q is false. Justify your answer using a truth table.</li>

 <li>Is ∼ <em>Q </em>⇒ <em>P </em>∨ (<em>P</em>∧ ∼ <em>Q</em>) a tautology, a contradiction or a contingent statement? Justify your answer.</li>

 <li>Prove, using cases, that for every natural number <em>n </em>≥ 1 the expression <em>n</em><sup>2 </sup>+ <em>n </em>+4 is not a prime number.</li>

</ul>

<strong>Question 3. [2 Marks] </strong>Use a truth table to show that the following is a valid argument.

<em>P </em>⇒ <em>Q</em>

∼ <em>P</em>

∴ ∼ <em>Q.</em>

<strong>Question 4. [4 Marks] </strong>In this induction question, full marks will only be awarded for writing out a <em>full </em>argument, like those in the examples from lectures. That is, make it clear which step you’re doing, and write out what Claim <em>k </em>and Claim <em>k </em>+ 1 are, then wrap up the argument with a concluding sentence (“Therefore, by induction,

<em>…</em>”).

Prove by mathematical induction that  for all <em>n </em><sup>∈ </sup>N.
